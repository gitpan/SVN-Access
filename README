SVN-Access version 0.01
====================

DESCRIPTION

SVN::Access includes both an object oriented interface for manipulating
SVN access files (AuthzSVNAccessFile files), as well as a command line
interface to that object oriented programming interface (svnaclmgr.pl).

Gil Hicks has a much better description of this module...

Definitely a jackhammer, I'm in there with some pressure and when I'm
done, you're not the same as before.  You're changed.
